### Soli Sandbox Demos

Programs demonstrating the Soli radar sensor in Google Pixel 4 mobile devices, developed for Soli Sandbox: 

* "soli-fly": shoo a housefly with a swipe gesture. [Video](https://vimeo.com/448186906) • [App](https://soli-fly.glitch.me/)
* "soli-jello": spank a bouncy cube with a swipe gesture. [Video](https://vimeo.com/448186018) • [App](https://soli-jello.glitch.me/)

We have also created two "dashboard" (debug view) apps for previewing Soli and other sensor data: 
* [https://soli-dashboard.glitch.me/](https://soli-dashboard.glitch.me/): shows Soli events
* [https://soli-dashboard-plus.glitch.me/](https://soli-dashboard-plus.glitch.me/) -- shows Soli events, plus gyroscope & accelerometer


### ScribblePuzzle

This [work-in-progress](https://github.com/LingDong-/scribblepuzzle) is not yet public.
